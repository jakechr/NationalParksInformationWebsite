    <h2>Want to hike with me?</h2>
    <p>I'm looking for people to join me on my incredible hikes. While it's peaceful
      to hike alone, it's always more fun to hike with others. Reach out to me if you
      want to join me on my amazing adventures.</p>
    <p>I am also currently taking hike recommendations. Please send me some new
      ideas through my email or on social media.</p>
